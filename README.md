# Paper Notes

This repo contains the notes that i've take while i was reading the paper

For DB part, mostly i was referring the reading list in CMU15-721

For Distribute part, mostly i was referring the MIT6.824, but there is also some paper from other reading list.

And HPC part is a quick introduction to GNN training system/Graph processing system.

The reading list that i'm referring:
[CMU15-721](https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2020/schedule.html)
[MIT6.824](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2021/schedule.html)
[PingCAP](https://github.com/pingcap/awesome-database-learning)
[AwesomeDistributedSystems](https://github.com/theanalyst/awesome-distributed-systems)

If you have questions while reading those paper, feel free to contact and have a discussion with me. I'm interested in digging details on those papers with others.

Happy Reading!
